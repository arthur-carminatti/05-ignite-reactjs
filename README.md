# Ignite Ui

<h2>Project Description</h2>
Welcome to the "Ignite UI" project, part of the 'Ignite' course by Rocketseat. In this project, we utilized ReactJS with TypeScript and created the project using Next.js. Additionally, we incorporated Storybook to create a comprehensive Design System.

The Ignite UI project serves as a Design System, providing a centralized and standardized set of styles and components for the entire project. It includes the standardization of colors, sizes, fonts, spacing, layouts, and more, ensuring a consistent and visually cohesive user interface.
